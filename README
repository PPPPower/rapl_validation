These are instructions for how to reproduce the results from the
Memsys2016 paper.

The experiments were done with the following equipment:
	+ A WattsUpPro power meter (USB) hooked to a recording device
	+ A MeasurementComputing USB 1608FS-PLUS A/D converter
	+ Various DIMM extender boards instrumented with sense resistors
	+ A custom ATX-P4 measurement cable connected to 
		an ACS715 Hall effect Sensor (Pololu #1186)
	+ An INA122 instrumentation amplifier amplified the
		differential voltage across the DIMM sense resistor.
	+ A serial port with a wire coming from the DTR line
		that we hook up to the ADC for synchronization purposes

Tools used:
	Besides the ones included here, also we used the
		wattsup and mc1608fs-plus
	tools found at
	https://github.com/deater/uarch-configure
