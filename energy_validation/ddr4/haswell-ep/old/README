These results were measured with the daq in 8-channel single-ended mode.
The results were much worse than the ones measured in 4-channel differential.

It is possible the difference was because the ground from the server
was not properly connected to the ground on the DAQ (the ddr4 extender
doesn't have a ground-connector).  We use the ground from the USB-serial
for the differential runs, this was not connected directly to common
ground on the single-ended.
