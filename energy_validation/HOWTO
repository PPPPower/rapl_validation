install the 4.1.5 kernel on the machine (no changes in kernel, just
for consistency).

Have the perf-4.1.5 patched to toggle the serial port in the right place.

Make sure we have system wide access to perf events
	echo "0" > /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid

Make sure our user has access to /dev/ttyUSB0 (usually involves adding
our user to the "dialout" group.


run daq on measurement machine
	On DDR3/haswell:
		sudo ./daqflex -b -c4 -d -r 1000 -o out.raw

	On DDr4/haswell-ep:
		sudo ./daqflex -b -c8 -s -r 1000 -o out.raw

quickly

run the benchmark on instrumented machine

stop the daq when benchmark complete

copy results to central location


Generate summaries
	On Haswell:
	../../../../../tools/perf_dram_results sleep.perf > rapl_summary
	zcat sleep_1000.raw.gz | ../../../../../tools/dump_watts_ddr3 > daq_summary


	On Haswell-ep:
	../../../../../tools/perf_dram_results_new sleep.perf > rapl_summary
	zcat sleep_1000.raw.gz | ../../../../../tools/dump_watts_ddr4 > daq_summary
