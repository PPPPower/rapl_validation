We ran Kerbal Space Program ksp-linux-1-0-4.zip
Obviously we cannot include this here.

Start the game (the X86_64 version), launch a rocket.  
In this case the stock Keral X rocket.
Copy the provided quicksave into place.

Start the "make_overhead.sh" script.  As soon as it starts,
press and hold F9 to load the quicksave.  Then use "shift" to throttle
up, then press "space" twice to launch.
As soon as the overhead script increments, repeat (starting with F9).

Not entirely reproducible, but seems to work well enough.
