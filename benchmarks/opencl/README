We ran the smallptgpu benchmark
from ocltoys-linux64-v1.0.zip
https://code.google.com/archive/p/ocltoys/

Booted specially patched 4.0.5 of kernel.
Note that on this kernel the uncore memory counters crash the kernel,
don't use them.

We started X.
echo 0 > /sys/module/i915/parameters/enable_cmd_parser
enter smallptgpu directory
Ran "make_overhead.sh"
This will run the opencl raytracer.  Press "Q" when the iterations
hit 250 (manually) and that will start the next cycle.


TODO: much more info on how to get beinget installed.  I know
I have it recorded somewhere.
