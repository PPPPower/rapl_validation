haswellian_initial	-- initial results
haswellian_cohpc2015	-- results put into the (rejected) coHPC workshop paper
haswellian_espt2015	-- results in the Extreme Scale Programming Tools
				Workshop Presentation
			   Also used in the MEMSYS-2016 paper

Unfortunately there was a gap between gathering the results and writing
this up, so I will describe as best I can how things were generated.

For example, I will describe the hpl_mkl results

	hpl_mkl.perf -- results of the "perf" command, running on the
			instrumented system
	hpl_mkl.stdio -- messages the benchmark printed to stdout when
			running on the instrumented system
	hpl_mkl.wup   -- results from the WattsUpPro power meter
			(gathered on the measurement system)
	hpl_mkl.daq   -- results from the MC A/D board
			(gathered on the measurement system)

For gathering results, first the wattsuppro and daq measurements
were started.  Then on the instrumented machine the perf command
was run.  Once it was done the wattsup/daq were manually stopped.

After that the .jgr (Jgraph) file was created.  Alignment was based on the
serial port DTR triggers.  This was manually aligned by cutting and pasting,
although the "find_pulse" tool helped with this.

The various "generate-*" C programs were used to extract the perf data.
The various "energy-*" C programs were used to change the average power
results into total energy results for use in the tables in the 
paper.
